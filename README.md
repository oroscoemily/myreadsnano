# MyReads Project

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this template is to save time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. Your job will be to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.



To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Backend Server

To simplify the development process, they've provided a backend server for us to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods needed to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
